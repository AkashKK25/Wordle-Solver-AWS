# AWS Deployment Architecture for Wordle Solver

## Overview
This document outlines the AWS architecture designed for deploying the Wordle Solver application at scale. While the current version is deployed using alternative methods, this architecture presents a production-ready AWS deployment strategy.

## Architecture Components

### Domain & Content Delivery
- **Route 53**: DNS management for custom domain (e.g., wordlesolver.yourdomain.com)
- **CloudFront**: CDN service to deliver static assets with low latency globally
- **Certificate Manager**: Handles SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS

### Compute & Orchestration
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Runs the Flask application in containers
  - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage
  - Multiple availability zones for redundancy
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across container instances
  - Health checks to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic
  - SSL termination for secure connections

### Storage
- **S3 Buckets**: 
  - Static assets bucket: CSS, JavaScript, and images
  - Dictionary bucket: Stores word lists for the application
  - Logs bucket: Stores application access logs

### Monitoring & Logging
- **CloudWatch**: 
  - Application logs from the Flask application
  - Metrics for application performance
  - Alarms for critical thresholds
- **X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for request analysis (future enhancement)

### Security
- **Security Groups**: Firewall rules to control traffic to instances
- **IAM Roles**: Limited permissions for service access
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Protection against common web exploits

## Scaling Strategy
The architecture is designed to scale automatically based on demand:
- ECS auto-scaling for compute resources
- CloudFront for handling traffic spikes
- Read-only data pattern eliminates database scaling concerns

## Deployment Process
1. Code is pushed to GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions triggers CI/CD pipeline
3. Application is containerized with Docker
4. Container image is pushed to ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
5. ECS service is updated with new image
6. Blue/Green deployment ensures zero-downtime updates
